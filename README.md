####  XTRABYTES Consolidated Interactive TErminal

XCITE is the core application utilizing the XTRABYTES Proof-of-Signature blockchain protocol. Built to support modules like a decentralized exchange and a fully-integrated chat protocol, the SHA512 encrypted network is quantum resistant and lightning fast. The code-fluid architecture means any developer looking to make a third-party DApp can use the XTRABYTES API to build out their dream project. XCITE is poised to be a top contender in the all-in-one decentralized applications industry.

## Getting Started

#### Install Qt

XCITE development requires the Qt cross-platform framework. If you don't have Qt installed you download it from [here](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) for free. 

#### Install Additional Features

During installation, be sure to pick the "Qt 5.9.3" component since that is the version our development is currently targeting. If you plan to compile Windows binaries, also include the Tools -> MinGW 5.3.0 component.

#### Project Configuration

After installing Qt, clone this repository and open xcite.pro using Qt Creator.
